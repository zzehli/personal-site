        Title: About me
        Content: |
            I am pursuing a master's degree in Agricultural Economics at University of Illinois. My academic interest lies in environmental economics and sustainable farming ðŸŒ½ practices.

            I love coding. Specifically, I am interested in designing and implementing systems. I wrote a toy version of [Git](https://github.com/zzehli/gitlet) that supports branching operations.
